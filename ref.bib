% Elastic-net-based Machine learning for Understanding (EMU) to reduce LIGO detector networks' false alarm rate and enhance glitch detection confidence. All environmental and detector data channels hadn't been previously attempted due to scale and complexity.
% LIGO observatories detect GW by monitoring changes in the detectors' length down to below $\SI{10^{-19}}{\frac{\meter}{\sqrt{\hertz}}}$, which requires closely monitoring the detector and its environment.
% The paper also explores using the EMU method to classify glitches into subsets based on their properties, demonstrating that some glitch subsets are easier to identify than others.
